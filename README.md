# Arduino_Training
This is the code for the Marston Science Library Arduio training. Students learned the basics of interactive physical computing. In the training students were taught the basics of arduino prototyping: how to read a schematic and how to wire their project. Students were also taught the basics of arduino coding: how to install the Arduino IDE, how to download and edit code, and how to compile and upload their code to an Arduino board.
